# Cache Simulator (C)

A configurable cache simulator written in C that models direct-mapped, set-associative, and fully associative caches with FIFO and LRU replacement policies. Supports optional next-block prefetching and reports cache performance statistics.

## Features
- Direct-mapped, N-way set associative, and fully associative caches
- FIFO and LRU replacement policies
- Optional next-block prefetching
- Tracks cache hits, misses, memory reads, and writes

# Notes
This project was originally developed as part of a computer architecture course.
All course-specific autograding and trace files have been removed to present a clean,
standalone implementation.


## Build
```bash
make
